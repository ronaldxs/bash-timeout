# NAME

timeout - Send a TERM (or other) signal after a specified duration to a
command if it has not already completed.  Attempt to replicate GNU timeout
with bash function if check for GNU timeout fails.  The duration is passed to
"sleep" and so can be any value accepted by your system sleep command.

# SYNOPSIS

    $ timeout 2 bash -c 'echo abc; sleep 3; echo def'
    abc
    $ echo $?
    124

## Switches

- **-p**

    Preserve exit code from signalled process.  If bash timeout tried to end its
    command with a signal after the timeout duration then the exit code is normally
    124\.  The **-p** option requests that bash timeout use the exit code of the
    signalled process which should usually be 128+(signal number).

- **-s**

    Alternative signal to be passed to kill if you want a signal other than TERM
    after the duration expires.  Again any value accepted by your system kill
    should work but do not pass a leading '-' (so -sINT and not -s-INT).
